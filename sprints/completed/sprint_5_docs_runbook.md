# Sprint 5 — Documentation and Operational Runbook

## Sprint Goal

Deliver complete setup and operational documentation for local and containerized execution.

## Backlog / Tasks

- Update README with architecture overview and pipeline execution paths.
- Add a step-by-step runbook for local run, cron run, and Docker run.
- Document SQLite schema and sample SQL queries for verification.
- Add troubleshooting section (permissions, cron startup, volume mount, token/env config).
- Add convenience commands (Makefile/task script) for build/up/down/logs/inspect-db.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A new user can run the pipeline end-to-end using docs only.
- Documentation includes verification commands and expected outputs.
- Common failure cases have clear remediation instructions.
- README and runbook are consistent with actual project behavior.
