# Sprint 6 — Demo Hardening and Submission Readiness

## Sprint Goal

Prepare a deterministic, presentation-ready final deliverable for assignment grading.

## Backlog / Tasks

- Build a short demo script: initial run, scheduled rerun, persisted-history proof.
- Add DB inspection command/script to show latest runs and top products.
- Add requirement traceability checklist mapping assignment requirements to implementation artifacts.
- Final validation pass across tests, container startup, persistence, and scheduler cadence.
- Tag release and freeze final submission instructions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Demo flow runs end-to-end without manual code edits.
- Assignment requirements are explicitly mapped and verifiable.
- Final release tag and instructions allow reproducible grading.
- All critical checks pass before submission.
